## Initial changes:
I have turned the features implemented in the previous DJS into it's own seperate components and called within the App.jsx:
- sort = src\components\Sort.jsx
- filter = src\components\Filter.jsx
- pagination = src\components\Pagination.jsx
- Header = src\components\Header.jsx (Contains the search function)
- Podcast-grid = src\components\Podcast-grid.jsx
